The [Fig.1](graph1.png) represents the number of articles published between the years 1994 and 2009. It is evident that the contributions in the field of quantum mechanics have been deliberately increasing, reaching their highest point in 2007. This trend indicates a growing interest in the richness of quantum mechanics and its advancements. Another noteworthy observation pertains to the comparison between articles published in scientific journals and those remaining in the ArXiv repository. [Fig.2](graph2.png) illustrates the number of articles uploaded to ArXiv versus the number of articles that were published. The results indicate a positive trend, as more articles were published compared to those remaining as ArXiv files. However, the graph shows a decline in 2009, which warrants further investigation.
